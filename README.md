# PHYS250FinalProjectCorso
Simulations of the Martian dipole magnetic shield made in Python.
The main.py file contains the main testing code.
stepcalculations.py contains functions related to calculations that need to be made on a step-by-step basis with the particle simulator.
particlegenerator.py is in charge of creating the solar wind particles.
electronTrajectory.py is retrofitted code from an example from the UChicago physics directory, which contains the actual trajectory simulation and visualization tools.
